For this assignment, I recreated a version of a popular game Texas Hold'em,
3 Card Poker. Since there wasn't a realistic way to create a two player game
of Hold'em on one screen, I decided to make 3 Card Poker where the player
plays against the house. Three cards are initially dealt to the player and to
the house. The player cannot see what the house has. When the player sees
their cards, they have a choice to fold and lose their intial bet or to bet the
same amount again. If they choose to bet, the dealer's hand flips over and a winner
is decided. The ranking of hands are different in this version. It goes
Straight Flush, 3 of a Kind, Straigh, Flush, Pair, and High Card. The player 
keeps playing until he goes bust.
